# 📖 Overview

This project is an AI-powered image classification system designed to identify Hindu idols from uploaded images.

The application leverages **Transfer Learning** using **EfficientNetB0** and provides an elegant **Streamlit-based web interface** for real-time predictions.

Apart from identifying the idol, the application also displays confidence scores, probability distribution, and allows users to compare two idol images simultaneously.
